# EIT_mapper_vae

This repository contains a final build variational autoencoder (vae) and mapper, to train an AI image reconstruction.
One data-set example is provided in `data/`.

 -> Topic of the future is to add the functions that are required to produce training data.

## 1. Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

You have to run this first and you have the choice between:
- Standart VAE
- Beta VAE

## 2. Mapper

If the vae run was succesfull, you can train the mapper
based on the same data-set.
